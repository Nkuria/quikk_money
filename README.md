#QUIKK MONEY
> A client wants to build a web platform that can enable users to register and send money to each other within the system. They top up their accounts through MPESA* and can now transfer amongst themselves. They use the registered number or email address to transfer.  Once a transfer is done, the recipient receives a notification in the system as well as a confirmation through email. A user should be able to trigger an email report summarising all the transactions they have done for a selected number of days. The users will use the application mostly on their phones so it should work well on a mobile browser.
